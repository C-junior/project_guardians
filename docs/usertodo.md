# User TODO - Project Guardians

> [!NOTE]
> These are tasks that require your creative input, decision-making, or external actions. The game can be developed without these, but they will enhance the final product.

## 🎨 Art & Visual Assets

### High Priority
- [ ] **Create Hero Statue Sprites** - The existing class portraits work but animated statue versions would be ideal
  - Recommended size: 128x128 or larger
  - Consider 4 visual tiers: Base → Enhanced → Awakened → Divine
  - Current classes: Knight, Mage, Archer, Paladin, Berserker, Guardian, Cleric, Assassin, Druid, Necrodancer

- [ ] **Create Map Tileset** - For the arena backgrounds
  - Medieval/fantasy stone paths
  - Grass, dirt, mystical rune-marked tiles
  - Placement grid indicators

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **UI Theme Graphics**
  - Shop panel frames (medieval fantasy style)
  - Button styles (stone/gold aesthetic)
  - Health/cooldown bar designs

- [ ] **Additional Enemy Sprites**
  - Dragon Whelp (flying enemy)
  - Shielded Knight
  - Shadow Imp
  - Troll Brute

- [ ] **Effect Sprites/Particles**
  - Attack projectiles per statue type
  - Ability VFX (chain lightning, ground slam, ice prison, etc.)
  - Evolution merge sparkles


 TODO for later (placeholders in use):
Replace statue portraits with actual statue sprites (currently using assets/classes/*.png)
Add more enemy sprites (currently only 5 exist)
Add artifact icons if missing textures
The crystal uses a simple colored square placeholder
### Low Priority
- [ ] **Alternative Arena Backgrounds** (for variety in later waves)
- [ ] **Boss-specific sprites** (larger, more detailed)
- [ ] **Artifact icons** (already have 13, might want more)

## 🎵 Audio (LAST PHASE)

### Music
- [ ] **Main Menu Theme** - Epic medieval orchestral
- [ ] **Combat Theme** - Intense, escalating battle music
- [ ] **Preparation Phase Theme** - Calm, strategic mood
- [ ] **Boss Battle Theme** - Climactic, urgent

### Sound Effects
- [ ] Attack sounds per statue type
- [ ] Enemy death sounds per type
- [ ] UI clicks, purchases, rerolls
- [ ] Ability activation sounds
- [ ] Win/lose jingles

## 📝 Creative Decisions Needed

### Game Balance (After Prototype)
- [ ] Review and adjust statue costs

### Story/Lore (Optional Enhancement)

### Monetization/Distribution (Future)
